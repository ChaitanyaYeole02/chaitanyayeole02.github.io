Each team consists of two robots: one Manual Robot(MR) and an Automatic Robot(AR). On the field are 3 rings at various heights and a golden disk. MR is only allowed to deliver the shuttlecock to the AR whose task is to shoot. AR can throw shuttlecocks from Throwing Zone(TZ) 1, 2, and 3. If the shuttlecock successfully goes through the rings from the throwing zones then the respective team will earn points. The AR is only allowed to move to the TZ3 after scoring points from TZ1 and TZ2. The first team to get the shuttlecock through the golden ring(ring at the highest distance) and into the golden disk is declared the winner of the match. This type of winning is called "RONG BAY" (Flying Dragon).

                The theme of the Robocon 2019 was set by Mongolia. The theme(GREAT URTUU) consisted of passing through different obstacles to transfer the gerege to the automatic robot, picking up shagais in the proper orientation, and throwing them into the landing zone. The automatic robot needs to be a quadruped robot that could collect the gerege, pass through different obstacles, and climb up the mountain to raise the gerege without falling down. There were many challenging aspects in this theme like developing a working quadruped robot that can perform various tasks without toppling.
                 Designing of the mechanism which can pick up the shagais and throw them in an efficient manner.
